<h1>Experiment 5</h1>
<p>To implement decision making statments in programs in C++</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  Decision-making statements in C++ control program flow based on conditions.  The `switch` statement selects one of many code blocks based on an expression's value, enhancing program flexibility and logical structuring.The `if`, `if-else`, and `else if` statements evaluate conditions to execute code blocks accordingly.The if statement allows for executing a block of code if a condition is true, and can be extended with else if and else for multiple conditions. The switch statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable, making it a suitable choice for situations with multiple possible discrete values. The conditional operator ?: offers a compact syntax for simple if-else conditions. These decision-making constructs enable developers to create dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to varying inputs and scenarios, forming the backbone of logic control in software applications
